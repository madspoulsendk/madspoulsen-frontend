                <p>My name is Mads and I'm a 25 year old Web Designer. I live in a small town called Ikast with my girlfriend. In my sparetime I use quite some time roasting, brewing and drinking coffee.
                    <br/>
                    <br/> I focus on living in the present and try to improve myself on a mental level every day. Therefore I love long-distance running because the automatic focus on breathing gives me a meditation-like state. With that being said I always go the extra mile to win.</p>

                <h3>Personally...</h3>

                    <br/>
                    <br/>That being said I‘m a team player. I bring laugther and joy to the team and priorities my relationship with colleague both duing and after work hours.</p>

                <h3>To make a long story short</h3>
                <p>I currently work as a webdesigner at the Danish Web Agency Co3 where my main focus is on consumer conversion behavior and measurable webdesign.
                    <br/>
                    <br/> I love working with great User Interface and designs, but more importantly is understanding the customer and their needs. I have great experience with cross-culture communication. Through Bestseller I had daily dialogue with Asian suppliers and at Co3 I work with Danish and other European customers.
                    <br/>
                    <br/> I‘m responsible for my own projects which has given me experience within everything from project management to design and communication with both large and small companies.

                <p>No one ever said you had to wait to make your mark on the world. No one ever said that adults are the only ones who can change the way people see the world. It's only those who are true to themselves, the ones who dare to be different, who shape the future.</p>
