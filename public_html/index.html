                <p>My name is Mads and I'm a 25 year old Web Designer. I live in a small town called Ikast with my girlfriend. In my sparetime I use quite some time roasting, brewing and drinking coffee.

                <h3>Personally...</h3>
                <p>I‘m a perky and comitted young guy who loves challenges. I‘m passionate, enthusiastic and focused. I‘m willing to learn and I have the right attitude. I am disciplined, independent and hard working.
                <br/><br/> I focus on living in the present and try to improve myself on a mental level every day. Therefore I love long-distance running because the automatic focus on breathing gives me a meditation-like state. With that being said I always go the extra mile to win.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>That being said I‘m a team player. I bring laugther and joy to the team and priorities my relationship with colleague both duing and after work hours.</p>

                <h3>To make a long story short</h3>
                <p>I currently work as a webdesigner at the Danish Web Agency Co3 where my main focus is on consumer conversion behavior and measurable webdesign.
                    <br/>
                    <br/> I love working with great User Interface and designs, but more importantly is understanding the customer and their needs. I have great experience with cross-culture communication. Through Bestseller I had daily dialogue with Asian suppliers and at Co3 I work with Danish and other European customers.
                    <br/>
                    <br/> I‘m responsible for my own projects which has given me experience within everything from project management to design and communication with both large and small companies.
